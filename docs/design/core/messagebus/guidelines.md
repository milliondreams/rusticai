## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This document outlines the coding guidelines and standards for the modular message bus library. Adhering to these guidelines ensures consistency, readability, and maintainability of the codebase.

## 2. Naming Conventions <a name="naming-conventions"></a>
* Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and modules
* Follow Python's [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) naming conventions:
  * Variables and functions: `lowercase_with_underscores`
  * Classes and exceptions: `CapWords`
  * Constants: `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`
  * Modules: `lowercase_with_underscores`

## 3. Formatting and Style <a name="formatting-and-style"></a>
* Follow Python's [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for formatting and style
* Use a maximum line length of 79 characters
* Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
* Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code
* Use parentheses to make complex expressions more readable
* Use spaces around operators and after commas
* Use single quotes for string literals, unless single quotes are used within the string

## 4. Comments and Documentation <a name="comments-and-documentation"></a>
* Write clear and concise comments to explain complex or non-obvious code
* Use [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) docstring conventions for function, class, and module documentation
* Keep comments and documentation up-to-date as the code evolves

## 5. Error Handling <a name="error-handling"></a>
* Use exceptions to handle errors and unexpected situations
* Catch specific exceptions rather than using a generic `except` clause
* Raise appropriate exceptions with meaningful error messages
* Use context managers (`with` statement) to ensure proper resource management

## 6. Code Organization <a name="code-organization"></a>
* Organize related functions and classes into modules
* Use a separate module for constants and shared utility functions
* Use absolute imports instead of relative imports
* Use `__all__` to control what is imported when using `from module import *`

## 7. Testing <a name="testing"></a>
* Write unit tests for individual components, covering both expected and edge cases
* Write integration tests to verify the interaction between components
* Write system tests to validate the library's performance and behavior under realistic scenarios
* Ensure that all tests pass before merging changes into the main branch

## 8. Version Control and Commit Messages <a name="version-control-and-commit-messages"></a>
* Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate with other developers
* Write descriptive and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of the changes
* Use imperative mood in commit messages (e.g., "Add new feature", "Fix bug")
* Group related changes into a single commit, and separate unrelated changes into separate commits

By following these coding guidelines and standards, developers can ensure that the modular message bus library's codebase remains consistent, readable, and maintainable. Adhering to these guidelines also promotes a positive development environment and facilitates collaboration among team members.

Remember to keep these guidelines in mind during the development process and encourage all team members to follow them for the success of the project.
