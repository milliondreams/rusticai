## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

### 1.1 Purpose <a name="purpose"></a>
This document provides a detailed solution specification for the modular message bus library, building upon the technical requirements and design specifications provided in the previous document.

### 1.2 Scope <a name="scope"></a>
This document covers the architecture, components, detailed design, and integration and testing plan for the message bus library.

## 2. Solution Overview <a name="solution-overview"></a>

### 2.1 Architecture <a name="architecture"></a>
The modular message bus library will be built with a modular and extensible architecture, utilizing design patterns such as Factory, Strategy, and Observer patterns to create a flexible and maintainable solution.

### 2.2 Components <a name="components"></a>
The library will consist of the following components:
* Message Bus Core
* Storage Backend Interface
* Routing Policy Interface

## 3. Detailed Design <a name="detailed-design"></a>

### 3.1 Message Bus Core <a name="message-bus-core"></a>
The Message Bus Core will be responsible for managing agent connections, message routing, and storage backend interactions. It will be implemented as a Python class, with methods for connecting agents, sending messages, and subscribing agents to receive messages.

#### 3.1.1 Agent Connection Management
The Message Bus Core will maintain a list of connected agents, allowing agents to connect and disconnect from the message bus. Connection management methods will include:
* `connect(agent)`: Connects an agent to the message bus.
* `disconnect(agent)`: Disconnects an agent from the message bus.

#### 3.1.2 Message Routing
Message routing will be handled by the Message Bus Core, utilizing the Routing Policy Interface to apply routing decisions. Methods for sending and broadcasting messages will include:
* `send_message(sender, message, recipients)`: Sends a message from the sender to the specified recipients.
* `broadcast_message(sender, message)`: Broadcasts a message from the sender to all connected agents.

### 3.2 Storage Backend Interface <a name="storage-backend-interface"></a>
The Storage Backend Interface will be an abstract class that defines the API for interacting with different storage backends. Concrete storage backend implementations will inherit from this class, implementing the necessary methods for storing and retrieving messages.

#### 3.2.1 Storage Backend API
The Storage Backend Interface will define the following methods:
* `store_message(message)`: Stores a message in the storage backend.
* `get_messages(filter)`: Retrieves messages from the storage backend based on the provided filter.

### 3.3 Routing Policy Interface <a name="routing-policy-interface"></a>
The Routing Policy Interface will be an abstract class that defines the API for applying message routing decisions. Concrete routing policy implementations will inherit from this class, implementing the necessary methods for determining message recipients.

#### 3.3.1 Routing Policy API
The Routing Policy Interface will define the following methods
