## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

### 1.1 Purpose <a name="purpose"></a>
This document provides a detailed architecture specification for the modular message bus library, building upon the technical requirements, design specifications, and solution specifications provided in previous documents.

### 1.2 Scope <a name="scope"></a>
This document covers the architectural overview, component architecture, and interaction and communication between components in the message bus library.

## 2. Architectural Overview <a name="architectural-overview"></a>

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture <a name="high-level-architecture"></a>
The modular message bus library will consist of three main components: Message Bus Core, Storage Backend Interface, and Routing Policy Interface. The architecture will be modular, scalable, and extensible, allowing for the seamless integration of new storage backends and routing policies.

### 2.2 Design Principles <a name="design-principles"></a>
The library will adhere to the following design principles:

* **Modularity**: Components will be designed to be easily replaceable and extensible, promoting maintainability and adaptability.
* **Scalability**: The architecture will be designed to handle an increasing number of agents and messages without significant performance degradation.
* **Separation of Concerns**: Each component will have a specific responsibility, ensuring a clean and manageable architecture.

## 3. Component Architecture <a name="component-architecture"></a>

### 3.1 Message Bus Core <a name="message-bus-core"></a>
The Message Bus Core will be the central component of the library, responsible for managing agent connections, message routing, and storage backend interactions. It will maintain a list of connected agents and manage their subscriptions to receive messages.

### 3.2 Storage Backend Interface <a name="storage-backend-interface"></a>
The Storage Backend Interface will define an abstract class that provides a standard API for interacting with various storage backends. Concrete storage backend implementations will inherit from this class, implementing the necessary methods for storing and retrieving messages.

### 3.3 Routing Policy Interface <a name="routing-policy-interface"></a>
The Routing Policy Interface will define an abstract class that provides a standard API for applying message routing decisions. Concrete routing policy implementations will inherit from this class, implementing the necessary methods for determining message recipients.

## 4. Interaction and Communication <a name="interaction-and-communication"></a>

### 4.1 Agent-Message Bus Interaction <a name="agent-message-bus-interaction"></a>
Agents will interact with the Message Bus Core by connecting to the message bus, sending messages, and receiving messages based on their subscriptions. The Message Bus Core will notify agents of new messages using the Observer pattern.

### 4.2 Message Bus-Storage
Backend Interaction <a name="message-bus-storage-backend-interaction"></a>
The Message Bus Core will interact with the storage backend through the Storage Backend Interface. This interaction will involve storing messages and retrieving messages from the storage backend. The Factory pattern will be used to instantiate the appropriate storage backend based on configuration.

### 4.3 Message Bus-Routing Policy Interaction <a name="message-bus-routing-policy-interaction"></a>
The Message Bus Core will interact with the routing policy through the Routing Policy Interface. This interaction will involve applying routing decisions to determine the recipients of a message. The Strategy pattern will be used to switch between different routing policies at runtime, allowing for dynamic routing behavior.

## 5. Extensibility and Customization <a name="extensibility-and-customization"></a>

### 5.1 Adding New Storage Backends <a name="adding-new-storage-backends"></a>
To add a new storage backend, developers should create a new class that inherits from the Storage Backend Interface and implement the required methods. The Factory pattern will allow the Message Bus Core to create instances of the new storage backend based on configuration.

### 5.2 Adding New Routing Policies <a name="adding-new-routing-policies"></a>
To add a new routing policy, developers should create a new class that inherits from the Routing Policy Interface and implement the required methods. The Strategy pattern will allow the Message Bus Core to switch between different routing policies at runtime, enabling dynamic routing behavior.
