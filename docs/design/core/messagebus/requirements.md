## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

### 1.1 Purpose <a name="purpose"></a>
This document outlines the technical requirements and design specifications for a modular message bus library in Python, intended to serve as a backend for a multi-agent chatroom system. The message bus must be modular, scalable, and support multiple storage backends.

### 1.2 Scope <a name="scope"></a>
This document covers the requirements, architecture, components, and design patterns related to the development of the message bus library.

## 2. Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>

### 2.1 Functional Requirements <a name="functional-requirements"></a>

#### 2.1.1 Instantiation
The library should allow for the instantiation of one message bus per chatroom.

#### 2.1.2 Agent Connection
Multiple agents should be able to connect to the message bus as clients and write messages on it.

#### 2.1.3 Message Broadcasting
Messages may be:
  * Broadcast to all connected agents
  * Sent to a select subgroup of agents
  * Sent to a single agent

This can be determined by either:
  * A routing policy configured for the message bus instance
  * The intended recipient(s) set by the sender on the individual message

#### 2.1.4 Pluggable Storage Backend
The message bus should support pluggable storage backends for storing messages, including:
  * In-memory priority list
  * File-based storage
  * Redis database
  * Relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)

### 2.2 Non-functional Requirements <a name="non-functional-requirements"></a>

#### 2.2.1 Modularity
The message bus should be designed with a modular architecture to allow for future extension and easy maintainability.

#### 2.2.2 Scalability
The message bus should be capable of handling an increasing number of agents and messages without significant performance degradation.

## 3. Architecture and Design <a name="architecture-and-design"></a>

### 3.1 Components <a name="components"></a>

#### 3.1.1 Message Bus Core
The core component of the message bus library, responsible for managing connections, routing messages, and interfacing with storage backends.

#### 3.1.2 Storage Backend Interface
An abstract interface for implementing various storage backends, providing a standard API for the message bus core to interact with different storage solutions.

#### 3.1.3 Routing Policy Interface
An abstract interface for implementing different routing policies, providing a standard API for the message bus core to apply message routing decisions.

### 3.2 Design Patterns <a name="design-patterns"></a>

#### 3.2.1 Factory Pattern
Utilize the factory pattern for creating instances of different storage backends and routing policies, based on configuration.

#### 3.2.2 Strategy Pattern
Use the strategy pattern for selecting and applying routing policies, allowing the message bus core to change routing behaviors dynamically.

#### 3.2.3 Observer Pattern
Employ the observer pattern to notify connected agents of new messages
